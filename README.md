# ETHZ_CIL_exam_prep

This is a rough guide on how I prepared for the Computational Intelligence Lab exam at ETH Zurich in spring 2020 (thus everything referenced here refers to the course as it was held then). This way of preparing for the exam might not work for everyone, it did for me, if you can take anything useful away from it, that's great.

## Determining available time to prepare for this exam
I first made a study plan for the whole summer (June through end of exams in August). In that I marked time to prepare for all exams, time to finish projects, about 2 weeks of vacation and most weekends off. I divided up total time to study between all the courses and I ended up with 17 half-days to prepare for the CIL exam. (If you have more or less time available, that's fine, just try to use your available time as well as possible).

## Dividing up the available time
Here is the template I used:
[Lernplan Ãœbersicht.pdf](https://github.com/ferraric/ETHZ_CIL_exam_prep/files/6650770/Lernplan.Ubersicht.pdf)

I rated the available material by my estimate of how important they are. According to that, I first looked at all available old exams at (https://exams.vis.ethz.ch/category/ComputationalIntelligenceLab). I planned 1 half-day for each of them.

Next, I reserved 2 half-days for repetition and as buffer in case something were to take longer than expected.

Then went through all lecture topics, listed the associated exercises, and divided the remaining available time among those topics.

I then put all the half-days from the template into my calendar, s.t. for every half-day I directly saw what I had to do. I adhered to this schedule pretty strictly, meaning if I did not get through everything from a topic, I still moved on to the next one (and moved the remaining part to the buffer/repetition half-days).

Make sure to plan solving the old exams rather close to the actual exam and after you solved all the exercises and went through all the topics.

The whole planning thing took me about one day for all courses I took that semester in total.

#### Going through lecture topics and exercises
I went through the slides (this year you might want to go through the script) and noted everything that I found important on a sheet of paper.
Example of how this might look:

This helped me retain the information better and allowed me to more easily review things again. In total I ended up with 14 pages of hand-written notes.

I made sure to get through the lectures quickly enough to have enough time to solve (without looking at the solutions) and correct the associated exercises. It was probably about 50:50 of time spent on lectures vs. on exercises.

#### Going through old exams
I tried to solve the old exams in as close to an exam setting as possible. I used no help, had a timer and made sure not to get interrupted. After I solved the exam, I corrected it using the community solutions. All the questions I got wrong, I went through again, discussed them with friends or in the community solutions tool to ensure I understood them.

## Side notes
I did not look at the projects or any programming assignments for the exam. Don't quote me on this though if coding gets asked in the exam.
